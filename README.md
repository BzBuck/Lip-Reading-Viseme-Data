# Lip Reading Viseme Data with a CNN
# Artificial & Biological Vision Final Project

In this project, I set out to use Convolutional Neural Networks to create a system for lip reading using only visual data. Below is my target pipeline, which was slightly altered due to limitations but remains mostly accurate to the actual implementation. I ended up changing a lot through the process and went back and forth with ideas, which has probably left some deprecated portions I missed.
